Marlin 2.0.7 for Sidewinder X1 V4 with the following upgrades: SKR 1.4 Turbo, TMC2208, BLtouch, and Stock MKSTFT28 Touchscreen. I recommend flashing the BTT firmware to the MKSTFT28, I am not sure how well it works without, but regardless, the added features alone are worth it. https://github.com/PrintEngineering/MKSTFT28_Clone_Artillery-Sidewinder. You will need to change the TFT connector to the board from  double-row connector to a single row of 5 pins. Check the TFT (next to connector) and SKR (TFT connector, pins listed on back of board)to match the 5v, Gnd, RX and TX pins then connect. The reset pin is not used here and is instead connected to the EXP1 connector just like on the MKS board. The wires should already be in the proper order and just need to be alligned the right direction. The BLtouch connects to the Servo connector for the 3 colored wires and the probe connector next to it for the black and white wires, black is optional and not used, allowing you to use the LED connectors for BLtouch.
